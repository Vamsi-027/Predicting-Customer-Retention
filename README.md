# Predicting-Customer-Retention
## Problem Statement
  One of the topmost banks in Europe wants to understand their customer data in-detail and trying to
  extract the patterns causing for customer churn (i.e., bank is losing its existing customers). In order to
  solve this problem, they have retrieved the customer data from the database which contains the
  information of both churned and active customers. Develop a machine learning model that can predict
  whether the given customer would churn in the near future or not. 

## Data: “BankCustomerChurn.csv”,variables are self-explanatory.
